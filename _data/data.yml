    heading: About Me
    text: |
      Hi, I'm Jack. I'm a Senior Data Scientist at JP Morgan. I spend my time pulling
      apart data (and various bits of tech), seeing how it works, and then
      putting it back together again; mostly in the correct order.
      
      My day job uses Python, R, and a bunch of other tools to apply the
      scientific method to data analysis; testing hypothesese, building models
      and communicating my results in a visual, easy to understand manner.

    heading: What I Do
    text: |
      I work on a variety of projects, varying between the visual,
      the technical, and (occasionally) the useful.
      
      These projects are almost always open source. Feel free to check them
      out, fork a project, or even put in a pull request if you have any
      suggestions or improvements.

    heading: Check Out My Blog
    text: |
      Some of projects I work on end in, or start as, blog posts. 
      
      These can be about computers, technology, statistics, or anything else
      I was randomly interested in that week.
      
      Most posts are backed by a git repository, so feel free to have a look,
      fork the repo, or even put a pull request in.
