      Hi, I'm Jack. I'm a Data Scientist at JP Morgan. I spend my time pulling apart data (and various bits of tech), 
      seeing how it works, and then putting it back together again; mostly in the correct order.     
      My day job uses Python, R and a bunch of other toolsto apply the scientific method to data analysis; 
      testing hypothesese, building models and communicating my results in a visual, easy to understand manner.
